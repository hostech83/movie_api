Project Description
Project Name: Moro-Flix API

Brief Description:
Moro-Flix is a RESTful API that serves as the backend for a movie database application. It provides endpoints for managing user data and movie information, including the ability to register users, authenticate, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on movies and user data. The API is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, with Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library. Authentication is handled via JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Reflection
Role and Tasks:

Role: Full-stack developer.
Tasks:
Designing and implementing the API endpoints.
Setting up the MongoDB database and defining schemas using Mongoose.
Implementing user authentication and authorization using JWT.
Writing validation and error-handling middleware.
Ensuring data integrity and security.
Decisions and Consequences:

Decision: Chose to use JWT for authentication.
Reason: JWT is stateless and allows for scalable authentication solutions.
Consequences: Simplified session management but required careful handling of token expiration and security.
Decision: Utilized Mongoose for MongoDB interactions.
Reason: Mongoose provides a straightforward schema-based solution to model application data.
Consequences: Simplified database interactions and data validation but required an understanding of Mongoose-specific syntax and methods.
What Would I Do Differently?

Improved Error Handling: Implement more granular error messages and logging to facilitate easier debugging and maintenance.
Automated Testing: Implement automated tests (unit and integration) to ensure the reliability and stability of the API.
Lessons Learned:

Importance of Validation: Ensuring that all user inputs are validated and sanitized is crucial to maintaining data integrity and security.
Efficient Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling and logging can save a lot of time during the debugging process.
Documentation: Keeping thorough documentation (both in-code and external) helps in maintaining the project and onboarding new developers.
Example User Registration Request in Postman
To register a new user, you can use the following JSON data in Postman:

Endpoint:

bash
Copy code
POST /users
Headers:

bash
Copy code
Content-Type: application/json
Body:

json
Copy code
{
  "username": "testUser123",
  "password": "securePassword123",
  "email": "testuser123@example.com",
  "birthday": "1990-01-01"
}
Response:
If the request is successful, you will receive a response with the newly created user object. If there are validation errors, you will receive a 400 status code with details of the errors.

By following these steps and reflections, the project was successfully implemented, providing a robust backend for the movie database application.
